# RuntimeTerror
Code for Group 8 Project 3 <br/>
The main source files (which include our group data structure implementation and gui code) are outside of the zip file. <br/>
AllClass.h has all of the Data Structure implementation and code that we collaborated on. <br/>
Form1.h is the Gui code where the AllClass functions were implemented. <br/>
Form1.cpp contains the main to run the gui. <br/>
There are 3 zip files which are the project folders. They contain everything, including all header and cpp files, the executable, debug folder and gui related files. In case more info is needed, please access the zip files. They are separated due to size limit.
